# 90-Days-Journey-with-python
Over the course of 90 days, I am going to go through a total transformation by Learning Python from scratch. I want to master the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) and learn the modern programming concepts to take me closer to my aspirations. My commitments extend beyond just theoretical understanding. I shall diligently engage in comprehensive Python programming practice, spanning from the root level fundamental concepts to the most advanced, exquisite concepts.

With this transformative journey, my core ambition and focus will be to harness the power of python and learn techniques to implement data structures and the intricate art of algorithm design. So as far you can understand my quest of earning knowledge will not be confined within theoretical domain but will be meticulously applied in practical settings. I want to become an AI Product Analyst and Business Intelligence Professional.
